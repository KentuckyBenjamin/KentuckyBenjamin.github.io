                    <h2>Jackpot Data Science Group</h2>
                </a>
                <p>My first startup! My friend Collin and I started Jackpot in the summer of 2019. Headquartered in NYC, the business took a significant blow during the first year of the pandemic. It is still active, but is now mostly used for side projects.
                </p>

                    <h2>Data + Design</h2>
                </a>
                <p>This is a partnership I’ve formed with my friend and Colleague Phuong, a designer who has her own
                    <a href="https://www.partnersincompany.com/" , style="color: #212121;"> <u>design consultancy</u>. </a> We both agree that Data and Design go hand-in-hand and, as such, we’ve teamed up on a series of combined consulting offerings.</p>

                    <h2>Jackpot Insights</h2>
                </a>
                <p>Jackpot Insights is an Alpha Test developed to explore the potential of a private market data platform akin to Pitchbook, but specifically for lower and middle market firms. It received some great feedback; there is definitely potential
                    here.
                </p>

                <a href="https://www.kyclite.com" , style="color: #212121;">
                    <h2>KYC-Lite</h2>
                </a>
                <p>KYC-Lite, too, is an Alpha Test. I developed this to explore the value of a ‘no-frills’ KYC-focused search tool. Of the various side projects I’ve developed, this is the most exciting to me, both for its market potential and for its overall
                    cool factor.</p>

                <a href="https://www.usacovidtrends.com" , style="color: #212121;">
                    <h2>USA COVID Trends</h2>
                </a>
                <p>This application is still web-hosted and view-able, but it is no longer being maintained. This was built during the early phases of the pandemic, when actual COVID data -- not opinions -- was quite difficult to find.</p>

                <a href="https://www.beckyrocks.com" , style="color: #212121;">
                    <h2>Becky Rocks</h2>
                </a>
                <p>I love my wife so very much. In my spare time, I like to make her goofy little apps and old-school themed video games (themed ‘Super Painter Girl’). Becky Rocks is a flask application I built to house some of that stuff, though I honestly
                    do a poor job maintaining it.</p>

                    <h2>Becky's Beau</h2>
                </a>
                <p>Becky’s Beau was a fun weekend project to visualize the growth data of my son, Judson, for his first 100 days of life. He was born pre-mature, and really struggled to put on weight his first few weeks. As a result, we kept a ledger of
                    his feeds. This app visualizes that data.</p>
