                <p>Good Scrapes is a collection of web-scraped recipes from some of my wife’s favorite cooking sites, most notably: Martha Stewart (thus the title ‘Good Scrapes’).</p>

                <p>This is a 'dumping ground' of thoughts, reflections, and notes, most of which are quite rough. (In fact, some notes aren't even even complete thoughts.).</p>

                </a>
                <p>Small Search is a full-text search & recommendation engine for landscaping firms in the southeast. It is a proof of concept for the power of creating small, focused search applications for business needs that cannot be satisfied through
                    traditional search engines. </p>

                </a>
                <p>This is a retro-themed video game website I made for my wife. This was a fun Christmas project and one I intend to maintain going forward. Developing retro games is relaxing, and I believe the harsh limitations of the approach actually
                    encourage creativity.</p>

                </a>
                <p>The KYC-Lite Alpha test received such overwhelmingly positive feedback that I've decided to more thoughtfully pursue this effort. The Beta is up and running. It can be viewed at the link above.</p>

                </a>
                <p>KYC-Lite was an Alpha test I developed this to explore the value of a ‘no-frills’ KYC-focused search tool. Of the various side projects I’ve developed, this is the most exciting to me, both for its market potential and for its overall
                    cool factor.</p>

                <p>This is a full-text search engine for the databases of some of my wife's favorite museums. It is a Dash application hosted on Heroku currently, but I'll likely try to convert this to a static page in early 2022.

                <p>Jackpot Insights is an Alpha Test developed to explore the potential of a private market data platform akin to Pitchbook, but specifically for lower and middle market firms. It received some great feedback; there is definitely potential
                    here.

                <p>This application is still web-hosted and view-able, but it is no longer being maintained. This was built during the early phases of the pandemic, when actual COVID data -- not opinions -- was quite difficult to find.</p>

                </a>
                <p>I love my wife so very much. In my spare time, I like to make her goofy little apps and old-school video games (themed ‘Super Painter Girl’). Becky Rocks is a flask application I built to house some of that stuff, though I honestly do
                    a poor job maintaining it.</p>

                </a>
                <p>Becky’s Beau was a fun weekend project to visualize the growth data of my son, Judson, for his first 100 days of life. He was born pre-mature, and really struggled to put on weight his first few weeks. As a result, we kept a ledger of
                    his feeds. This app visualizes that data.</p>

                <p>This was a fun afternoon project to use Obsidian.md to make a Knowledge Graph of bible characters. For context: ‘knowledge graphs’ are basically the digital equivalent to those link analysis charts you often see crime shows.</p>

                <p>This was a silly game I made for my wife using PyGame. Unfortunately there is no way to host games written in PyGame on a browser. Here are some screenshots, however.</p>

                <p>A friend of mine works in the energy sector and was considering founding a consultancy ('Prescience') to help energy and utilities firms forecast maintenance issues. I put this together for him over a weekend to help him with initial client

                </a>
                <p>My team at work put together a tool for assembling private market data (like Pitchbook without all the useless features). When we were advertising the tool early on, I put this app together to show samples of the data and a recommendation
                    engine built on top of it.</p>

                <p>News Noise Filter is a simple application I created for personal use. It is a filter for news websites whereby one can search for topics of interest to have articles screened-in and of disinterest to have articles screened out. Additionally,
                    it scrapes all the relevant articles and returns a plain text html file (so no ads, clickbait, etc.). A sample output is hyperlinked above.</p>

                <p>Rebecca-Fi is as an application whereby users can upload a photo and have it generated to ASCII art (with or without color). I made this because Rebecca inspired me with a lesson she gave her students about iconography. The link above
