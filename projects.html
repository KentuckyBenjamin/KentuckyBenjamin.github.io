                <p>Toast's Rabbit Roundup is a PICO-8 game I made for my friends Collin, Sora, and their corgi Toast. </p>

                <p>This is a retro-themed video game website I made for my wife.</p>

                </a>
                <p>KYC-Lite was an Alpha test I developed this to explore the value of a ‘no-frills’ KYC-focused search tool. Of the various side projects I’ve developed, this is the most exciting to me, both for its market potential and for its overall
                    cool factor.</p>

                </a>
                <p>My first startup! My friend Collin and I started Jackpot in the summer of 2019. Headquartered in NYC, the business unfortunately took a significant blow during the first year of the pandemic.

                    <h2>Becky's Art Finder</h2>
                </a>
                <p>This is a full-text search engine for the databases of some of my wife's favorite museums. It is a Dash application hosted on Heroku currently, but I'll likely try to convert this to a static page in early 2022.

                </a>
                <p>This is a partnership I’ve formed with my friend and colleague Phuong, a designer who has her own
                    <a href="https://www.partnersincompany.com/" , style="color: #212121;"> <u>design consultancy</u>. </a> We both agree that Data and Design go hand-in-hand and, as such, we’ve teamed up on a series of projects.</p>

                    <h2>Jackpot Insights</h2>
                </a>
                <p>Jackpot Insights is an Alpha Test developed to explore the potential of a private market data platform akin to Pitchbook, but specifically for lower and middle market firms. It received some great feedback; there is definitely potential
                    here.

                    <h2>USA COVID Trends</h2>
                </a>
                <p>This application is still web-hosted and view-able, but it is no longer being maintained. This was built during the early phases of the pandemic, when actual COVID data -- not opinions -- was quite difficult to find.</p>

                    <h2>Becky Rocks</h2>
                </a>
                <p>I love my wife so very much. In my spare time, I like to make her goofy little apps and old-school video games (themed ‘Super Painter Girl’). Becky Rocks is a flask application I built to house some of that stuff, though I honestly do
                    a poor job maintaining it.</p>

                    <h2>Becky's Beau</h2>
                </a>
                <p>Becky’s Beau was a fun weekend project to visualize the growth data of my son, Judson, for his first 100 days of life. He was born pre-mature, and really struggled to put on weight his first few weeks. As a result, we kept a ledger of
                    his feeds. This app visualizes that data.</p>

                <h2><a href="bible_character_knowledge_graph.html" , style="color: #212121;">Building a Knowledge Graph of Bible Characters</a></h2>
                <p>This was a fun afternoon project to use Obsidian.md to make a Knowledge Graph of bible characters. For context: ‘knowledge graphs’ are basically the digital equivalent to those link analysis charts you often see crime shows.</p>

                <h2><a href="super_painter_girl.html" , style="color: #212121;">Super Painter Girl (My First Video Game)</a></h2>
                <p>This was a silly game I made for my wife using PyGame. Unfortunately there is no way to host games written in PyGame on a browser. Here are some screenshots, however.</p>

                    <h2>Prescience Demo App</h2>
                </a>
                <p>A friend of mine works in the energy sector and was considering founding a consultancy ('Prescience') to help energy and utilities firms forecast maintenance issues. I put this together for him over a weekend to help him with initial client
                    interviews and pitches.</p>

                </a>
                <p>My team at work put together a tool for assembling private market data (like Pitchbook without all the useless features). When we were advertising the tool early on, I put this app together to show samples of the data and a recommendation
                    engine built on top of it.</p>

                    <h2>News Noise Filter</h2>
                </a>
                <p>News Noise Filter is a simple application I created for personal use. It is a filter for news websites whereby one can search for topics of interest to have articles screened-in and of disinterest to have articles screened out. Additionally,
                    it scrapes all the relevant articles and returns a plain text html file (so no ads, clickbait, etc.). A sample output is hyperlinked above.</p>

                    <h2>Rebecca-Fi</h2>
                </a>
                <p>Rebecca-Fi is as an application whereby users can upload a photo and have it generated to ASCII art (with or without color). I made this because Rebecca inspired me with a lesson she gave her students about iconography. The link above
                    has some sample outputs.</p>

                    <h2>Random Quote Generator</h2>
                </a>
                <p>The landing page of this website is actually a random quote generator. If you keep clicking on my name, quotes I’ve selected will refresh at random. It is a pretty simple JavaScript use case. Use the developer tools view to see the JavaScript
                    (and all of the quotes).</p>

                </a>
                <p>I've been experimenting with event listeners on static pages, with an eye towards creating an offline only page. This page is a proof of concept. This page shows different content depending on if you are online or offline. </p>

                <a href="comic_test.html" , style="color: #212121;">
                    <h2>Comic Book Website</h2>
                </a>
                <p>(This is a temp page while I work on a comic book that I'll be making into a website. Similar to the super painter girl temp-page, once it is complete I'll make it its own website, not an extension of my personal site)</p>

                </a>
                <p>(This is another temporary page while I explore
                    <a href="https://chartscss.org/" , style="color: #212121;"><u>charts.css</u></a>. The idea of hosting dashboards on static pages is really interesting to me, so I'm using this as a sandbox for testing out ideas.)</p>
