                    a
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/4IReW9QJwXU" , style="color: #212121;"><u>video demo</u></a> from an old client presentation.</p>

                <h2><a href="topics_of_interest.html" , style="color: #212121;">Topics of Interest</a></h2>

                <h2><a href="text_clustering.html" , style="color: #212121;">Text Clustering</a></h2>
                <p>This is a high-level overview of text clustering. Because this is such a big topic, this post is accompanied by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xKS8niYAFk&amp;feature=youtu.be" , style="color: #212121;"><u>video demo</u></a>                    from a “Data Talk” I once gave on this topic.</p>

                <p>In this post, I share an opinion on a few causes for terrible software & workflow tools and, more importantly, what business teams can do to avoid perpetuating the cycle of these tools.</p>

                <h2><a href="data_driven.html" , style="color: #212121;">What it Means to be 'Data Driven'</a></h2>
                <p>In this post and
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/hkGmE74Uhqs" , style="color: #212121;">
                        <u>video demo</u></a>, I provide my take on what it really is to be ‘data driven’. In doing so, I show a page out of my own playbook: how I use data to shape business development.</p>

                    in the current environment.</p>

                <p>Great teams relentlessly pursue mastery of the basics, and this holds especially true when working with data. Drawing lessons from the U.S. Marine Corps, I suggest a series of foundational elements to master working with data.</p>

                <p>Most Americans don’t understand they have a lot at stake when it comes to data privacy. There is a lack of familiarity on what constitutes sensitive personal data, how it is collected and (mis)used, and, most importantly, how to mitigate
                    the risks of having one’s data privacy violated.</p>

                <h2><a href="data_dictionary.html" , style="color: #212121;">Data Dictionaries</a></h2>
                <p>Data Dictionaries describe the content, format, and structure of a database as well as the relationship of elements within it. I urge those working with data to consider maintaining them a part of their team’s standard operating procedures.
                </p>

                <h2><a href="data_assessment.html" , style="color: #212121;">Assessing the Quality of Data</a></h2>

                <p>The term AI is widely abused. This post is an attempt to rid the hype and mysticism about this topic, and to simplify it by supporting it with examples.</p>
