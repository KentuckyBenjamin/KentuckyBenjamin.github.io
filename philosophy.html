                <p>Your job title outlines your general efforts, not the limits of your responsibilities. The current work environment frequently requires us to perform duties beyond the scope of our job descriptions, in areas completely foreign to us. Do
                    not be surprised or frustrated by these situations. Confidently embrace the challenge and rise to the occasion.</p>

                <h2 id="lifedoesntgiveyoubricksyoumakethem">Life doesn't give you bricks; you make them</h2>

                <p>Life doesn’t give you bricks; you make them. It is up to you to take responsibility of your life. If you don’t have the tools and resources to achieve your goals, make them. Create opportunities. Don’t expect others to give them to you.
                    If you don’t design your life, someone else will; you may not like the result. </p>

                <h2 id="thinkdifferently">Think differently</h2>

                <p>Think differently. It is not enough to be able to make decisions between right and wrong. The workplace is replete with complex, ambiguous, situations that require decisions between wrong and wrong. To negotiate such dilemmas, one must
                    be able to think outside the box. Therefore, broaden your horizons and strive to be someone of wide and varied learning. </p>

                <h2 id="whynotwhat">Why, not what</h2>

                <p>Why, not what. Every employee knows what their job is; most know how to perform their duties. Few people, however, actually know why they serve. We use terms like “bottom line” and “end state” to try to answer this question, but parlance
                    alone is insufficient. We must approach every endeavor first with the goal of answering the question why. Only then should we address how and what. </p>

                <h2 id="getalife">Get a life</h2>

                <p>Don’t put your quality of life in the hands of your employer. Don’t be so busy making a living that you forget to make a life. Invest time daily in your family, friends, and non-work related interests. Broaden your definition of success
                    to include your spiritual, intellectual, and physical well-being. </p>

                <h2 id="habitsdetermineperformance">Habits determine performance</h2>

                <p>If you wait for your “moment to shine” to be your best, you’ll fail. People don’t reason well under pressure. They don’t rise to the occasion. They buckle. They blank out. Good habits, if developed, drive success in high-pressure scenarios.
                    To excel in critical situations, develop strong, positive habits, today. </p>
